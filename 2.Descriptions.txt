Here are brief descriptions of each algorithm and when to use them:

Linear Search:
Description: Sequentially checks each element in a list until a match is found.
When to use: Suitable for small lists or unsorted data.

Binary Search:
Description: Divides a sorted list into halves, reducing the search space by half with each comparison.
When to use: Applicable for large, sorted datasets to efficiently find an element.

Bubble Sort:
Description: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements until the list is sorted.
When to use: Practical for small datasets or educational purposes, not efficient for large datasets.

Selection Sort:
Description: Iteratively selects the minimum element and places it at the beginning.
When to use: Simple to implement, suitable for small datasets.

Insertion Sort:
Description: Builds a sorted list one element at a time by repeatedly inserting elements into the sorted part.
When to use: Efficient for small datasets or partially sorted lists.

Merge Sort:
Description: Divides the list into halves, recursively sorts each half, and merges them.
When to use: Efficient for large datasets, guarantees O(n log n) time complexity.

Quick Sort:
Description: Chooses a pivot, partitions the list, and recursively sorts the partitions.
When to use: Efficient for large datasets, in-place sorting with good average-case performance.

Heap Sort:
Description: Builds a max-heap and repeatedly extracts the maximum element.
When to use: Suitable for large datasets, in-place sorting with O(n log n) complexity.

Radix Sort:
Description: Sorts integers by processing individual digits, from the least to the most significant.
When to use: Suitable for sorting integers with fixed lengths, linear time complexity.

Counting Sort:
Description: Counts the occurrences of each element and reconstructs a sorted list.
When to use: Efficient for a range of integers, linear time complexity.

Breadth-First Search (BFS):
Description: Explores all neighbors at the current depth before moving to the next level.
When to use: Shortest path problems, level-order traversal in graphs.

Depth-First Search (DFS):
Description: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
When to use: Topological sorting, maze solving, connected components in graphs.

Dijkstra's Algorithm:
Description: Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.
When to use: Single-source shortest path in weighted graphs with non-negative edges.

A Search Algorithm:
Description: An informed search algorithm that uses heuristics to efficiently find the shortest path.
When to use: Pathfinding in graphs with an estimate of the remaining cost.

Kruskal's Algorithm:
Description: Constructs a minimum spanning tree by adding edges in ascending order of weight.
When to use: Finding the minimum spanning tree in a connected, weighted graph.

Prim's Algorithm:
Description: Builds a minimum spanning tree by selecting the smallest edge at each step.
When to use: Finding the minimum spanning tree in a connected, weighted graph.

Bellman-Ford Algorithm:
Description: Finds the shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.
When to use: Single-source shortest paths, handles graphs with negative weights.

Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:
Description: Finds the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph.
When to use: All-pairs shortest paths in graphs with both positive and negative weights.

Topological Sort:
Description: Arranges nodes in a directed acyclic graph in a linear order.
When to use: Dependency resolution, task scheduling with prerequisites.

Knapsack Problem (Dynamic Programming):
Description: Finds the most valuable combination of items within a weight limit.
When to use: Optimization problems where items have weights and values.

Longest Common Subsequence (Dynamic Programming):
Description: Finds the longest subsequence common to two sequences.
When to use: String comparison, DNA sequence analysis.

Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):
Description: Finds the minimum weight set of edges that connects all nodes in a graph.
When to use: Network design, ensuring connectivity with minimum cost.

Graph Coloring:
Description: Assigns colors to vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.
When to use: Scheduling, register allocation in compilers.

K-means Clustering:
Description: Divides a set of data points into k clusters based on their features.
When to use: Unsupervised machine learning for clustering.

Convex Hull (Graham's Scan):
Description: Finds the smallest convex polygon that contains all given points.
When to use: Computational geometry, pattern recognition.
